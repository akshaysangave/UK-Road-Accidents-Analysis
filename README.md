# Introduction
The purpose of the UK Road Accidents Analysis Project is to analyse large amounts of traffic accident data in order to identify the key factors contributing to road safety issues. This study searches for trends and patterns in variables such as road kinds, light conditions, and weather. Providing helpful information to support policy decisions and increase road safety is the aim.
